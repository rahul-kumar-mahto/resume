        <p>HnCC or Hackathon and Coding Club is the official club of BIT Sindri that has the <br> motto to instill a coding culture, collaborate, and arrange events <br> relevant to Open Source, Graphics and Game Development, Web Development, <br> App Development, and many other topics. <br> Many students at the institute are doing well, but they can do <br> even more if they get proper guidance. These students invariably maintain contact <br> with a select lot of elite, wise seniors who act as mentors <br> or friends. The purpose of HnCC is to provide an official platform <br> for these efforts to encourage them by officially endorsing them and helping <br>them surmount the  hostel boundaries for a healthier <br> and fruitful network.</p>
